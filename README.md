# Research Project
This repository contains the source code for my project "Crop Yield Prediction" which was done in the spring semester of 2019. <br/>
This project aims to predict winter wheat yields based on location and weather data. It is inspired by [this](https://github.com/aerialintel/data-science-exercise) exercise and my own project Agro_Sense.
